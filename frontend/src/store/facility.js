// Facility Store (Zustand)
// This file is intended to manage facility-related state and operations (e.g., bookings, resources, time slots).
// Reference: @academic.js for store structure, state, and CRUD operation patterns.
// Reference: @useAuth.js for authentication helpers, role checks, and schoolId injection logic.

// TODO: 
// - Implement state for facilities, bookings, resources, and time slots
// - Add loading and error states for each entity.
// - Add CRUD operations for each entity, following the async/await and error handling patterns in academic.js.
// - Use authentication helpers from useAuth.js to inject schoolId and check user roles where needed.
// - Add utility functions for clearing errors and data, similar to academic.js.
